#Steinberg Cubase/Nuendo/Wavelab macro keyboard
##Background story
I am always looking for the best harddware controller that suits my needs. But to be honest, they always change. I ended up buying various Behringer controllers, Mackie, etc. But they always take up a lot of space and actually ddo not solve the chores I am actually doing mostly. Those are changing settings, composing and various other buttons that I am always looking for. So I decided to build something myself. 

My colleague who hsa various keyboards, mentioned he used ortho-linear keyboards. And they need to be programmed. After a small peek of interest, I quickly saw that they can be programmed with various multiple-key-commands in one stroke. So I thought.. ok, this is perfect for my needs. Get nice keys with tactile feedback and durable, and...well...then I need icons. 

Luckily, Steinberg already has most functionalities added with icons, but they are not all there. I ended up designing parts of them myself. 

There may be more people looking for something like this, so I decided to share my design to the rest. Below you can find my build. The folders contain various content you may need. 

##The keys
I bought Kailh Boxy white keys as well as Cherry MX Green keys. Both are clicky keys with a more firm press. I've bought a few Boxy keys, because the two key-caps for the programs themselves are translucent. Having green below red was not an option for me. However... they are lower compared to the Cherry MX Greens, so I may switch them out. Luckily, the OLKB Planck allows easy replacement of the keys, as they are hot-switchable, without soldering. 

##The keyboard itself
As mentioned before, I gotten the OLKB Planck. This is usually build in low quantities. Get them at: https://olkb.com/collections/planck

I also ordered the milled walnut body, just because it's really beatiful. See the pictures.  

## Rest comes later...
As there is much to type, but probably most of it not worth mentioning, I will keep the res tof the update for later.
